# Financial Analysis Standards

## Success Metrics & Functionality

### Core Analysis Capabilities

The system must be able to answer key financial questions:

- **Tax Analysis**: "How much did I pay in taxes last year?"
- **Spending Analysis**: "What did I spend last year by category?"
- **Income Analysis**: "What was my total income from all sources?"
- **Trend Analysis**: "How has my spending changed over time?"
- **Budget Analysis**: "How much did I spend vs. budget in each category?"

### Query Performance Requirements

- **Fast Response**: Query response times under 5 seconds for typical analysis
- **Scalable**: Handle growing data volumes efficiently
- **Reliable**: Consistent, accurate results across all queries
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update and extend with new analysis types

## SQL Query Standards

### Query Organization

- Use clear, descriptive names for all tables and columns
- Implement consistent naming conventions across all queries
- Add comments explaining complex business logic
- Structure queries for readability and maintainability

### Common Query Patterns

#### Tax Payment Analysis

```sql
-- Total taxes paid by year
SELECT
    strftime('%Y', date) as tax_year,
    SUM(amount) as total_taxes_paid
FROM transactions
WHERE category IN ('Federal Tax', 'State Tax', 'Property Tax')
    AND amount > 0  -- Tax payments are positive
GROUP BY tax_year
ORDER BY tax_year DESC;
```

#### Spending Analysis

```sql
-- Annual spending by category
SELECT
    strftime('%Y', date) as year,
    category,
    SUM(ABS(amount)) as total_spent
FROM transactions
WHERE amount < 0  -- Expenses are negative
    AND date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY year, category
ORDER BY year DESC, total_spent DESC;
```

#### Monthly Trends

```sql
-- Monthly spending trends
SELECT
    strftime('%Y-%m', date) as month,
    SUM(ABS(amount)) as monthly_spending
FROM transactions
WHERE amount < 0
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

## Analysis Best Practices

### Data Validation

- Always validate date ranges in analysis queries
- Check for data completeness before generating reports
- Handle edge cases like refunds, transfers, and corrections
- Verify category assignments and merchant data accuracy

### Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate indexes for common query patterns
- Implement query caching for frequently accessed analyses
- Optimize aggregation queries for large datasets
- Consider materialized views for complex recurring analyses

### Report Generation

- Provide clear, actionable insights from analysis
- Include data quality indicators in reports
- Format financial amounts consistently
- Add context and explanations for unusual patterns or outliers
