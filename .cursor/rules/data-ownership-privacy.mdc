# Data Ownership & Privacy Rules

## Core Principles

- **Full Control**: All financial data must be stored locally or in user-controlled environments
- **No Expiration**: Data retention is not subject to third-party app policies or subscription limits
- **Security First**: Implement robust encryption and access controls for all sensitive financial data
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant financial data handling regulations and standards

## Implementation Requirements

### Data Storage

- Store all financial data locally or in user-controlled cloud environments
- Never rely on third-party services for permanent data storage
- Implement encryption at rest for all sensitive financial information
- Use secure, user-controlled backup solutions

### API Integration

- When using external APIs (like Plaid), treat them as data sources, not storage
- Always maintain local copies of all retrieved data
- Implement secure credential management for API keys
- Use encrypted connections for all external API calls

### Privacy Protection

- Minimize data sharing with external services
- Implement data anonymization for analytics where possible
- Ensure user consent for any data processing
- Provide clear data handling documentation

## Security Standards

- Encrypt sensitive financial data at rest and in transit
- Implement secure authentication and authorization
- Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities
- Regular security audits and updates
- Secure API key management with environment variables or secure vaults
