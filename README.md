# MoneyBin - Personal Financial Data Aggregation

![MoneyBin Icon](docs/assets/moneybin-icon.png)

A self-hosted personal financial data aggregation and analysis system that provides functionality similar to Empower or Monarch Money while maintaining complete data ownership and control.

## Overview

MoneyBin allows you to:

- Extract structured financial data from CSVs, APIs, and tax PDFs (1040, W-2, 1099, etc.)
- Aggregate transaction data from all your bank accounts
- Store everything in a local DuckDB database
- Query your financial data with SQL for insights like:
  - "How much did I pay in taxes last year?"
  - "What was my total spending by category?"
  - "What are my monthly recurring expenses?"

## Key Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Data Ownership**: Your financial data stays under your control
- ‚úÖ **No Expiration**: Data doesn't disappear when subscriptions end
- ‚úÖ **Privacy First**: No third-party access to your sensitive information
- ‚úÖ **Customizable**: Build exactly the analysis you need
- ‚úÖ **Cost Effective**: No recurring subscription fees

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- uv package manager (recommended) or pip
- Git

### Fastest Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the provided Makefile:

```bash
# Complete development environment setup
make setup

# See all available commands
make help

# Check environment status
make status
```

This single command will:

- Check Python installation
- Create virtual environment with correct Python version
- Install uv package manager if needed
- Install all development dependencies
- Set up pre-commit hooks

### Alternative Setup Options

#### Option 1: Simple Manual Approach

1. Export CSV files from your bank accounts
2. Use Python scripts to extract data from tax PDFs
3. Import everything into DuckDB
4. Run SQL queries for analysis

#### Option 2: Automated with APIs

1. Set up Plaid API for automatic bank transaction sync
2. Use OCR services or Python libraries for PDF processing
3. Build automated data pipeline with scheduled updates
4. Create dashboards for ongoing monitoring

## Technical Architecture

The system follows a simple data flow:

```text
Tax PDFs + Bank Data ‚Üí Processing Scripts ‚Üí CSV Files ‚Üí DuckDB ‚Üí SQL Analysis
```

See the specialized strategy documents for detailed implementation approaches.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modern data engineering architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up manually or need to understand the individual steps:

#### 1. Python Version Management

The project includes a `.python-version` file for automatic Python version management:

```bash
# Install pyenv if not already installed (optional but recommended)
# macOS: brew install pyenv
# Linux: Follow https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation

# If using pyenv, it will automatically use the correct Python version
pyenv install --skip-existing
pyenv local
```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment (this is done automatically by 'make setup')
make venv

# Or manually with uv:
uv venv .venv --python 3.11
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install development dependencies (recommended - includes testing tools)
make install-dev

# Or install just main dependencies (production use only)
make install
```

#### 4. Framework Status

The project already has the following frameworks initialized:

##### Git Repository

- Already initialized and ready to use

##### Dagster Project

- Pipeline definitions are in the `pipelines/` directory
- Ready for development and deployment

##### dbt Core Project

- Located in the `dbt/` subdirectory
- Already configured with `dbt_project.yml`
- Ready for model development

#### 5. Configure Database Connection

##### DuckDB Setup

The project uses DuckDB as the analytical database. The dbt profile is already configured:

```yaml
# dbt/profiles.yml (already configured)
moneybin:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: duckdb
      path: 'dbt/dev.duckdb'
      threads: 4
  target: dev
```

#### 6. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for sensitive configuration:

```bash
# .env (do not commit to git)
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_plaid_client_id
PLAID_SECRET=your_plaid_secret
PLAID_ENV=development  # or production

# QuickBooks (if using)
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID=your_qb_client_id
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_qb_client_secret

# Database
DUCKDB_PATH=dbt/dev.duckdb
```

#### 7. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check environment status
make status

# Test Dagster (starts development server)
make dagster-dev

# Test dbt (navigate to dbt directory first)
cd dbt && dbt debug
```

The Dagster UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000` when running the development server.
